# Python Watson Recipe Bot

This project is based on the [Watson Recipe Bot example](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-developer-cloud/how-to-build-a-recipe-slack-bot-using-watson-conversation-and-spoonacular-api-487eacaf01d4#.i0q8fnhuu) and adds IBM Graph support.


This project requires [py-graph](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/py-graph) as a dependency. Clone py-graph and in your Virtual Environment for the Watson Recipe Bot run:

```
pip install -e <path_to_py_graph>
```

Work in progress!
